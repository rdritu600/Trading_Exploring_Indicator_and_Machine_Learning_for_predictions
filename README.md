# About Project

Understanding Trading Indicators by generating a timeline for : 
<br>"PAST - PRESENT - FUTURE"


## Past*
We aim at studying the stock prices of most popular organisations for the past 10 years. We have compared the profit a user can acheive had they invested their stock in a particular company xx no of years back and how much value the investment will have generate today.
Eg: If you have invested $1000usd 5 years back in Tesla stock, the value of that stock could have accelerated to around 8500 USD today and you will have over $7500usd in gains.

## Present*
Of course, Our coding in python is designed is such a way that as long you are aware of the ticker symbol, we can generate the stock values of just any company for any given period of time, including the current date. 

We have used 4 commonly used Trading indicators to define the BUY/SELL decision making for stock over a period of time and understand the signal for Entry and Exit to buy/sell the stock.



## Future*
While future is unpredictable,  we have tried incorporating Machine Learning to predict long term prices.

*This has been depicted in the graphs attached herewith.

## Trading Indicators used:

## 1. Dual moving Covergence Divergence :
The degree/magnitude of separation between a shorter and longer-term moving average (MA) denotes the strength of a trend. It also indicates the momentum of that trend.
 - ### Benefits: The MACD is a relatively simple indicator, easy to comprehend, appeals to intuitive logic and therefore resonates well with most traders.<br>
 - ### Limitations: One of the most significant limitations of the MACD is the occurrence of false positives. A reversal is signalled, but never takes place.
## 2. Bollinger Band : 
Bollinger Bands indicate whether an instrument's price is high or low on a relative basis. Bollinger Bands show when an instrument is in overbought or oversold territory.
 - ### Benefits: Bollinger Bands are a useful technical analysis tool. The bands are used to analyse volatility and trend strength, which is particularly useful when opening and closing trades quickly in a volatile market.
 - ### Limitations: Bollinger Bands are primarily reactive, not predictive. The bands will react to changes in price movements, either uptrends or downtrends, but will not predict prices.
## 3. Relative Strength Indicator
The relative strength index (RSI) is a popular momentum oscillator​​ that can be used to determine the future direction of a market. Traders can use the RSI to gauge whether momentum is accelerating or decelerating.
- ### Benefits: It is a versatile technical analysis tool and is most effective when combined with another method. For example, it can be used in conjunction with Bollinger Bands to determine if a security is stretched too far. Support and resistance levels measured by moving averages or trendlines can also be used to find levels where the market is oversold and finds support, or overbought and finds resistance.
- ### Limitations: RSI isn't always helpful, since it can move without featuring a clear trend for a long time. It can send misleading signals. 
## 4. Stochastic oscillator :
These are useful for predicting trend reversals. Stochastics measure the momentum of price movements. Like Bollinger Bands, Stochastic indicators can help traders identify overbought and oversold levels.
- ### Benefits: The stochastic indicator is a great tool for identifying overbought and oversold conditions over a specific time period. The stochastic oscillator is preferred by many traders when price is trading in a range because price itself is 'oscillating', leading to more reliable signals from the stochastic indicator.
- ### Limitations: While stochastic lines can indicate oversold levels or unnoticed bearish divergence in a given stock, they can also produce false signals. False signals are simply events that the stochastic oscillator incorrectly predicted.
